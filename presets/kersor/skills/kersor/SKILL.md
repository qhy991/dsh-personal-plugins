# KerSor DSH bridge

This skill is an adapter. The KerSor checkout owns its commands, defaults, workflow policy, and completion rules; do not restate or guess them here.

## Resolve the checkout

Use the bridge installed beside this skill:

```bash
bridge="${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}/.agent-presets/kersor/bin/kersor_bridge.py"
kersor_root="$(python3 "$bridge" root)"
```

`KERSOR_ROOT` overrides the checkout recorded by the installer. If resolution fails, stop and report the bridge diagnostic instead of guessing a path.

Before changing a KerSor checkout, read `$kersor_root/AGENTS.md`. Before running a workflow, read the relevant current command protocol under `$kersor_root/commands/` and any file it directly names.

## Route the request

- For a kernel file or task directory, preflight the direct route with `python3 "$bridge" compose optimize --path <path> --json`.
- For a bundled case, list or match cases first, then use `python3 "$bridge" compose build --case <id> --json`.
- For environment diagnosis, use `python3 "$bridge" doctor --runtime auto`.
- For status, call the `kersor_status` tool first. It reads canonical Session and Attempt Result stores and renders the live round, workflow, best measured speedup, target, fit, and recent decisions.
- For resume, trace, campaign, research, export, or a named workflow, read the matching `$kersor_root/commands/<name>.md` protocol. Use `kersor_status` before resume or diagnosis so the current session—not chat memory—sets the starting point.

The composer emits a `/kersor:<command>` string as validated parameter binding. It is not a shell command. Execute the matching command protocol with the tools available in DSH, preserving its gates, evidence files, confirmation points, budgets, and stop semantics.

## Operating rules

1. Inspect the target repository and its local instructions before mutation. Preserve unrelated worktree changes.
2. Use KerSor's scripts for deterministic facts and validation; keep engineering judgment in the agent as required by the current command protocol.
3. Treat the target task, spec, session files, and measured benchmark output as their documented sources of truth. Do not reconstruct state from chat memory.
4. Report the exact validation commands and measured result. Never claim an optimization without the benchmark evidence required by the selected protocol.
5. If `kersor_status`, the composer, or a required command protocol cannot be loaded, stop before mutation and report the exact failure. Do not simulate or bypass KerSor.
6. If a current KerSor file conflicts with this adapter, follow the KerSor file and flag the adapter drift for maintenance.
